Welsh Bros. established in 1794 and were the largest shipper of Madeira wine before the odium outbreak in 1852. They were important suppliers to the Russian and the Swedish courts. In 1893 John F. Welsh was appointed the Russian Consul. In the second part of the 19th century, Welsh Bros. focussed on shipping high quality bottled wines to the United States. They were known to mature their wines in "estufas do sol" rather than artificially heated estufas. Welsh Bros. co-founded the Madeira Wine Company in 1913. …</p>

              <p class="card_description" >Vintage Port
                A rare example of the Niepoort 1945 Vintage.  Rated 97 points from the Wine Spectator (in 1990)… 'Another Port shipper once mistook this extraordinary wine for one 15 years younger. It is very youthful, with caressing sweet fruit flavors. Medium garnet with a ruby center, blackberry, black pepper and smoke aromas, medium-bodied, with sweet blackberry.'  Voted as the best of the Niepoort vintages by thePortForum.com - Review: 60% opaque, red. Wonderful mature VP, still with structure. Mint and cherry, though fruit fading. Fabulous. Widely acclaimed, and overwhelmingly voted, wine of the night</p>

                Review by AHB - Portforum.com "A lovely rich red colour, warm and dark; 90% opaque. Showing little on the nose, but the little it is showing is warm and fruity — and very nice. A beautiful palate, soft entry with poise and balance. The fruit is generous, sweet and ripe and still plentiful. The palate is big and rich; stunning for a port of this age. The aftertaste is amazing — so full of fruit, of rich burnt fruitcake; mouthfilling and immense. This is stunning, stunning port.".  48 hours later a 6cl sample bottle was tasted which showed even mor ecomplexity, being sweeter and rounder than the pop 'n' pour version. …</p>

              <p class="card_description" >Noval Nacional Level in Neck- Good Label ***99/100 - Robert Parker***
                Noval is particularly famous for its Nacional, a Port produced in some years only from a 2 hectare parcel at the heart of the Noval vineyard where ungrafted pre phylloxera vines survive.  "Last July I enjoyed this "legend" at Noval and consumed my share of an entire bottle that was opened for our small group of Port journalists. This VP had a very dark ruby color and was clearly from a perfectly stored bottle. The 1963 is as lithe and graceful as a trapeze artist, and showed what perfection in balance is all about. It is not easy for Port to get much better than this. Sweet, spicy, grapey, mint, big, bold, brash are all apt descriptors. …</p>
