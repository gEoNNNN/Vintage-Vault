A beautiful palate, soft entry with poise and balance. The fruit is generous, sweet and ripe and still plentiful. The palate is big and rich; stunning for a port of this age. The aftertaste is amazing — so full of fruit, of rich burnt fruitcake; mouthfilling and immense. This is stunning, stunning port.".  48 hours later a 6cl sample bottle was tasted which showed even mor ecomplexity, being sweeter and rounder than the pop 'n' pour version. …</h2>

                Noval is particularly famous for its Nacional, a Port produced in some years only from a 2 hectare parcel at the heart of the Noval vineyard where ungrafted pre phylloxera vines survive.  "Last July I enjoyed this "legend" at Noval and consumed my share of an entire bottle that was opened for our small group of Port journalists. This VP had a very dark ruby color and was clearly from a perfectly stored bottle. The 1963 is as lithe and graceful as a trapeze artist, and showed what perfection in balance is all about. It is not easy for Port to get much better than this. Sweet, spicy, grapey, mint, big, bold, brash are all apt descriptors. …</h2>
