## Implementation

- **HTML Structure:**  
  The page is divided into semantic sections: navigation, home, description, and events. Each section uses descriptive class names for easy styling.
- **SCSS/CSS Styling:**  
  All styles are written in [style.scss](style.scss) and compiled to [style.css](style.css). The design uses custom fonts, color palette, and advanced positioning for layered effects.
- **Animations:**  
  Keyframe animations are used for fade-in and sliding effects on text and images.
- **UIkit Grid:**  
  The events section uses UIkit's grid classes for responsive layout.
- **Assets:**  
  All images and icons are stored in the [assets/](assets/) folder and referenced in the HTML for backgrounds, decorations, and event icons.

See [index.html](index.html) and [style.scss](style.scss) for the main implementation.
